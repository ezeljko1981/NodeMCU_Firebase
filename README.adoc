= NodeMCU_Firebase Library for NodeMCU =

This library allows an NodeMCU to connect to the NodeMCU_Firebase service.
NodeMCU_Firebase Library for :
 1. Measuring distance by Ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04 by NodeMCU, and sending value to Firebase. 
 2. Receiving commands for relay from Firebase.

 The circuit:
  Node MCU                   HC-SR04
  D3              ———->      Echo
  D4              ———->      Trig
  5V              ———->      VCC
  GND             ———->      GND

  Node MCU                   Relay
  D0              ———->      IN
  3.3V            ———->      VCC
  GND             ———->      GND
